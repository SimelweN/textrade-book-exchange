# 📊 Vercel Analytics Setup Guide

## ✅ **Error Fixed!**

The HMR error has been resolved by temporarily removing the Analytics import.

## 🚀 **Complete Setup Steps**

### 1. Install the Package

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
bun add @vercel/analytics
```

### 2. Re-enable Analytics in App.tsx

After installing the package, add these lines back to `src/App.tsx`:

**Add this import at the top:**

```typescript
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
```

**Add this component inside the CartProvider:**

```typescript
</Router>
<Analytics />
</CartProvider>
```

### 3. Enable in Vercel Dashboard

- Go to your Vercel project dashboard
- Click "Analytics" tab
- Click "Enable"

### 4. Deploy

```bash
vercel deploy
```

## 🔍 **What Happened?**

- The import `@vercel/analytics/react` was added before the package was installed
- This caused Vite to fail resolving the import
- HMR couldn't reload the file due to the missing dependency
- **Solution**: Install package first, then add the imports

## ✨ **Ready to Go!**

Once you install the package and re-add the imports, your analytics will be fully functional!
