# Courier Guy API Integration Implementation

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Loading Loop on Browse Books Page**

**Problem**: The "Browse Books" page was stuck in an infinite loading loop due to error handling in the book queries service.

**Root Cause**: The `handleBookServiceError` function was throwing errors that caused the component to remain in loading state forever.

**Solution**:

- Created a non-throwing version `logBookServiceError` for the books query
- Updated `getBooks` function to return empty array instead of throwing errors
- Added proper error boundaries and fallback states
- Fixed loading state management in BookListing component

**Files Fixed**:

- `src/services/book/bookErrorHandler.ts` - Added non-throwing error handler
- `src/services/book/bookQueries.ts` - Updated to use non-throwing handler
- `src/pages/BookListing.tsx` - Improved error handling and loading states

### 2. **Button Interaction Issues**

**Problem**: Buttons weren't triggering expected actions due to loading state management issues.

**Solution**: Previously fixed in the loading loop fixes.
