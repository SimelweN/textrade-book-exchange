# Course Assignment System - Complete Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Requirements Fulfilled**

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive course assignment system that meets all your specifications:

### ✅ **1. Universal Course Assignment ("all")**

- **Implementation**: Courses marked "all" are assigned to every university in the dataset
- **Example**: Construction Management, Quantity Surveying, MBChB, BPharm, etc.
- **Result**: These courses appear in all 26 South African universities

### ✅ **2. Exclusion-Based Assignment ("exclude")**

- **Implementation**: Courses are assigned to all universities except those in the exclusion list
- **Example**: Civil Engineering (exclude: UWC, UNISA, UFH) → Assigned to 23 universities
- **Result**: Accurate representation of which universities actually offer these programs

### ✅ **3. Include-Only Assignment ("Most except")**

- **Implementation**: Courses are assigned only to specified universities
- **Example**: Astronomy (Most except UCT, RU) → Only assigned to UCT and Rhodes
- **Result**: Specialized programs only appear at appropriate institutions

### ✅ **4. University-Specific APS Requirements**

- **Implementation**: Different APS scores per university for the same course
- **Example**: MBChB has APS 45 at UCT, 44 at Wits, 42 at UP, 40 at UKZN
- **Result**: Accurate admission requirements reflecting each university's standards

### ✅ **5. Faculty-Based Organization**

- **Implementation**: Courses are properly assigned to correct faculties
- **Example**: Engineering courses → Faculty of Engineering, Medical courses → Faculty of Health Sciences
- **Result**: Proper academic organization maintained

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

4. **`courseAssignmentIntegration.ts`** - Integration utilities and testing framework

### **Key Features:**

- ✅ **100+ Course Templates** with proper assignment rules
- ✅ **26 Universities** with accurate abbreviation mapping
- ✅ **8 Faculty Categories** with standardized naming
- ✅ **Flexible Assignment Rules** supporting all specified patterns

## 🔧 **Implementation Examples**

### **Usage Example 1: Get Courses for University**

```typescript
import { getAllCoursesForUniversity } from "@/services/universityCourseAssignmentService";

const uctCourses = getAllCoursesForUniversity("uct");
// Returns: All courses assigned to UCT based on assignment rules
```

### **Usage Example 2: Check Course Availability**

```typescript
import { isCourseAvailableAtUniversity } from "@/services/universityCourseAssignmentService";

const hasAstronomy = isCourseAvailableAtUniversity("bsc-astronomy", "wits");
// Returns: false (Astronomy only available at UCT, RU)

### **Usage Example 3: Get APS Requirements**

```typescript
import { getCourseApsForUniversity } from "@/services/universityCourseAssignmentService";

const uctMedicine = getCourseApsForUniversity("mbchb", "uct"); // 45
const ukznMedicine = getCourseApsForUniversity("mbchb", "ukzn"); // 40
// Different APS requirements for same course at different universities
```

### **Usage Example 4: Enhance University Data**
