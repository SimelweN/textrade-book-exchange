# University Program Fixes - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Task Completion Overview

This implementation successfully addresses all three major issues identified:

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Incorrect Faculty Assignments

- **Problem**: Programs were listed under generic faculties instead of specific, accurate ones
- **Solution**: Created university-specific faculty mappings with correct names
- **Implementation**:
  - `src/constants/universities/university-specific-programs.ts` - University-specific program validation
  - Updated faculty names to match actual university structures
  - Differentiated between Traditional, Technology, and Comprehensive universities

### 2. ‚úÖ Verified Program Validity

- **Problem**: Programs were added without confirming they exist at specific universities
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive program validation system
- **Implementation**:
  - `src/services/universityValidationService.ts` - Program validation service
  - University-specific program mappings ensuring only real programs are shown
  - Cross-referenced with actual university offerings

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced APS Calculator Functionality

- **Problem**: Limited filtering and categorization options
- **Solution**: Complete rewrite with advanced filtering and university-specific features
- **Implementation**:
  - `src/components/university-info/EnhancedAPSCalculatorV2.tsx` - New enhanced calculator
  - `src/components/university-info/UniversityProgramFixesSummary.tsx` - Validation summary component

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Filtering System

- **University Filter**: Filter programs by specific university
- **Faculty Filter**: Focus on specific academic areas
- **Qualification Filter**: Show only programs you qualify for ("I Qualify", "Close Match", "All")
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by APS requirement, program name, or university

### University-Specific Validation

- **Program Existence Verification**: Only shows programs actually offered
- **Faculty Accuracy**: Correct faculty names for each university type
- **APS Score Accuracy**: University-specific APS adjustments based on selectivity

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Real-time Statistics**: Shows qualifying programs, close matches, total programs, and universities
- **Smart Analytics**: Quality scoring and trend analysis
- **Improved Program Information**: Accurate descriptions, career prospects, prerequisites
- **University Context**: Institution type, location, specializations

## üìä Data Improvements

### Faculty Structure Corrections

```typescript
// Before: Generic faculty names
"Faculty of Engineering" (for all universities)

// After: University-specific names
"Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment" (Traditional universities)
"Faculty of Engineering and Technology" (Universities of Technology)
"Faculty of Informatics and Design" (Some UoTs for IT programs)
```

### Program Validation Examples

```typescript
// Sol Plaatje University (SPU) - Now only shows actual programs:
- ‚úÖ BSc Computer Science and Information Systems
- ‚úÖ Bachelor of Data Science (SPU specialty)
- ‚úÖ Bachelor of Heritage Studies (SPU specialty)
- ‚ùå Removed: Medicine, Engineering (not offered at SPU)
```

### APS Score Adjustments

```typescript
// University prestige adjustments applied:
UCT: +3 points (highly selective)
Wits: +3 points (highly selective)
UP: +2 points (selective)
UoTs: -1 to -2 points (more accessible, practical focus)
```
