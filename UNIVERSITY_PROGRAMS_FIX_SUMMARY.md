# University Programs Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Universities weren't showing programs and "View Details" wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**:

1. PopularUniversities component was using old university data without comprehensive programs
2. No university detail view component existed
3. UniversityInfo page had no logic to handle university-specific URLs

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Import Paths**

- Updated PopularUniversities to use comprehensive database: `@/constants/universities/index`
- Updated UniversityInfo page to use comprehensive database
- All components now use the comprehensive program database with 2,000+ programs

### 2. **Created University Detail View**

- **New Component**: `UniversityDetailView.tsx`
- Shows complete university information including:
  - All programs organized by faculty
  - Contact information
  - Admissions details
  - Campus information
  - Program details with APS requirements and career prospects

### 3. **Enhanced URL Handling**

- UniversityInfo now handles `?university={id}` parameter
- Clicking "View Details" navigates to: `/university-info?university=uct`
- Added back navigation to return to university list
- Proper SEO metadata for university-specific pages

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Testing**

- **Test Component**: `UniversityProgramsTest.tsx` (dev-only)
- Verifies universities have programs loaded
- Shows statistics: total universities, programs, averages
- Sample program details verification

## üîß Technical Implementation
