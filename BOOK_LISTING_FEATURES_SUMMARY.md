# Book Listing Management Features Implementation

## Overview

Implemented three comprehensive features for book listing management, notification system, and pickup address validation.

## âœ… Feature 1: Send Notification When Book Listing is Deleted

### Implementation Details

**Service**: `src/services/bookDeletionService.ts`
**Enhanced**: `src/services/admin/adminMutations.ts`

### Functionality

- **Automatic notifications** when books are deleted by admin or due to violation reports
- **Contextual messages** based on deletion reason
- **In-app notifications** stored in database
- **Extensible system** ready for email/push notifications

### Notification Content

```
Subject: Book Listing Removed

Your book listing "[Book Title]" has been removed because it did not comply with ReBooked Solutions' guidelines outlined in our Terms and Conditions.

[Reason-specific message]:
- Admin action: "This action was taken by our moderation team."
- Violation reports: "This may be due to multiple user reports or a violation of our content policies."
- Content policy: "This may be due to a violation of our content policies."

You may list the book again if it meets our standards.

Thank you for understanding.
```

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Enhanced admin deletion with notification
await BookDeletionService.deleteBookWithNotification(
  bookId,
  "admin_action",
  adminId,
);

// Automatic notification creation
await addNotification({
  userId: sellerId,
  title: "Book Listing Removed",
  message: contextualMessage,
  type: "warning",
  read: false,
});
```

### Integration Points

- **Admin Dashboard**: Updated deletion functions to send notifications
- **Moderation System**: Integrated with violation reporting
- **Notification Service**: Enhanced existing notification system

---

## âœ… Feature 2: Prevent Users from Listing Books Without Pickup Address

### Implementation Details

**Enhanced**: `src/pages/CreateListing.tsx`
**Service**: Validation in `BookDeletionService.validateUserCanListBooks()`

### Functionality

- **Pre-submission validation** checks pickup address before allowing listing
- **Clear error messages** guide users to add address
- **Automatic redirection** to profile page for address setup
- **Comprehensive validation** ensures all required address fields

### User Experience Flow

1. **User attempts to create listing**
2. **System validates pickup address**
3. **If missing**: Shows error and redirects to profile
4. **If incomplete**: Shows specific field requirements
5. **If valid**: Proceeds with listing creation

### Validation Logic

```typescript
const pickupValidation = await BookDeletionService.validateUserCanListBooks(
  user.id,
);
if (!pickupValidation.canList) {
  toast.error(
    pickupValidation.message ||
      "You need to add a pickup address before listing a book.",
  );
  navigate("/profile");
  return;
}
```

### Error Messages

- **No address**: "You need to add a pickup address before listing a book."
- **Incomplete address**: "Please complete your pickup address information before listing a book."
- **Validation error**: "Unable to verify pickup address"

---

## âœ… Feature 3: Deactivate Listings When Pickup Address is Removed

### Implementation Details

**Enhanced**: `src/pages/Profile.tsx`, `src/components/profile/UserProfileTabs.tsx`
**Components**: `src/components/UnavailableBookCard.tsx`
**Service**: `BookDeletionService.deactivateUserListings()` & `reactivateUserListings()`

### Functionality

- **Automatic deactivation** when pickup address is removed
- **Automatic reactivation** when pickup address is added back
- **Visual indication** of unavailable listings
- **Buyer protection** prevents purchases of unavailable items
- **Seller notifications** inform about listing status changes

### Visual Design for Unavailable Books

#### For Buyers (Public View)

- **Greyed out appearance** with overlay
- **Clear unavailable badge** with orange warning color
- **Informative message**: "Seller must add a pickup address to activate this listing"
- **Disabled interaction** prevents clicking/purchasing

#### For Sellers (Profile View)

- **Same visual treatment** as buyer view
- **Action required notice**: Orange highlighted box with guidance
- **Edit/Delete controls** still available
- **Clear instructions** to reactivate listings

### Smart Address Change Detection

```typescript
// Enhanced handleSaveAddresses with listing management
const hadPickupAddressBefore = addressData?.pickup_address && /* validation */;
const hasPickupAddressNow = pickup.streetAddress && /* validation */;

if (!hadPickupAddressBefore && hasPickupAddressNow) {
  // Reactivate listings
  await BookDeletionService.reactivateUserListings(user.id);
} else if (hadPickupAddressBefore && !hasPickupAddressNow) {
  // Deactivate listings
  await BookDeletionService.deactivateUserListings(user.id);
}
```

### Database Status Management

- **Status field**: Books marked as 'unavailable' when address removed
- **Bulk updates**: All user listings updated simultaneously
- **Atomic operations**: Address and listing status changes are coordinated

### Notification System

**Address Removed**:

```
Title: Listings Deactivated
Message: Your listing is currently unavailable because you removed your pickup address. Please add a pickup address to reactivate your listing(s).
```

**Address Added**:

```
Title: Listings Reactivated
Message: Your listings have been reactivated now that you have added a pickup address.
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Service Layer Organization

```
src/services/
â”œâ”€â”€ bookDeletionService.ts     # Main service for all features
