### 2. Shipment Quote Calculation Issues

**Problem:** Quote calculation system was not working properly with incorrect courier rates and poor error handling.

**Solution:**

- **Enhanced CourierGuy Quote Calculation:**

  - Added proper weight-based pricing (0.5kg to 3kg+ tiers)
  - Implemented location-based distance multipliers for South African cities
  - Added major city recognition (Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, etc.)
  - Improved delivery time estimation based on distance
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

- **Improved ShipLogic Quote Calculation:**
  - Added comprehensive input validation (addresses, parcel details)
  - Implemented proper error handling with specific HTTP status code responses
  - Added address validation before API calls
  - Added weight and dimension limits (0.1kg-50kg, dimensions > 0)
  - Added business day calculation for collection dates
  - Added fallback rates when API fails
  - Enhanced error messages for different failure scenarios

**Files Modified:**

- `src/services/courierGuyService.ts` - Enhanced quote calculation logic
- `src/services/shipLogicService.ts` - Added validation and error handling

**Key Improvements:**

```typescript
// CourierGuy: Enhanced pricing logic
const basePrice = 75;
const weightMultiplier =
  weight <= 0.5 ? 1 : weight <= 1 ? 1.2 : weight <= 2 ? 1.5 : 1.8;
const distanceMultiplier = sameCityCheck ? 1 : majorCityToMajor ? 1.4 : 1.6;

// ShipLogic: Input validation
if (request.parcel.weight <= 0 || request.parcel.weight > 50) {
  throw new Error("Parcel weight must be between 0.1kg and 50kg");
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 3. Notifications Display Bug

**Problem:** Multiple notifications were invisible or hidden, requiring mouse hover to become visible due to z-index and rendering issues.

**Solution:**

- **Enhanced CSS Z-Index Management:**

  - Added proper z-index stacking for notification cards
  - Implemented dynamic z-index based on notification order
  - Added transform and backface-visibility for hardware acceleration
  - Fixed button positioning with relative z-index

- **Improved Notification Rendering:**
  - Added proper event propagation handling (`e.stopPropagation()`)
  - Enhanced hover states with background colors
  - Added backdrop-filter for better button visibility
  - Implemented proper spacing and overflow handling

**Files Modified:**

- `src/pages/Notifications.tsx` - Enhanced notification card rendering
- `src/styles/mobile-improvements.css` - Added notification-specific CSS fixes

**Key Improvements:**

```css
.notification-card {
  position: relative;
  z-index: auto;
  transform: translateZ(0); /* Hardware acceleration */
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}

.notification-actions button {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
  z-index: 102;
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 4. Activity Log Inaccuracy

**Problem:** Activity log did not accurately reflect user actions (book uploads, listings, purchases).

**Solution:**

- **Enhanced Activity Logging System:**

  - Added comprehensive activity logging to book creation
  - Implemented purchase and sale activity tracking
  - Added profile update activity logging
  - Enhanced error handling for activity logging failures
  - Used notifications table as fallback for reliable storage

- **Integrated Activity Logging:**
  - Book listing: Logs when users create new book listings
  - Book purchases: Logs both buyer purchase and seller sale activities
  - Profile updates: Logs when users update their profile information
  - Comprehensive metadata tracking (book IDs, prices, user IDs)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/services/book/bookMutations.ts` - Added book listing activity logging
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` - Added purchase/sale activity logging
- `src/components/ProfileEditDialog.tsx` - Added profile update logging
- `src/services/activityService.ts` - Enhanced logging methods

**Key Features:**

```typescript
// Book listing activity
await ActivityService.logBookListing(userId, bookId, title, price);

// Purchase/sale activities
await ActivityService.logBookPurchase(buyerId, bookId, title, price, sellerId);
await ActivityService.logBookSale(sellerId, bookId, title, price, buyerId);

// Profile update activity
await ActivityService.logProfileUpdate(userId);
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 5. Book Price Input Validation

**Problem:** Price input allowed letters, special characters, and invalid formats instead of only numbers.

**Solution:**

- **Comprehensive Input Validation:**

  - Added real-time character filtering (numbers and decimal point only)
  - Implemented keyboard event blocking for invalid keys
  - Added decimal point limit (only one decimal point allowed)
  - Limited to 2 decimal places maximum
  - Added reasonable maximum value (999,999)
  - Enhanced focus/blur handling for better UX

- **Input Sanitization:**
  - Removed invalid characters in real-time
  - Prevented multiple decimal points
  - Blocked non-numeric keyboard input
  - Added proper pattern validation

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/create-listing/PricingSection.tsx` - Enhanced price input validation

**Key Improvements:**

```typescript
// Real-time character filtering
value = value.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, "");

// Keyboard event blocking
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Allow: backspace, delete, tab, escape, enter, decimal point
  if ([8, 9, 27, 13, 46, 110, 190].indexOf(e.keyCode) !== -1) {
    return;
  }
  // Block non-numeric keys
  if (
    (e.shiftKey || e.keyCode < 48 || e.keyCode > 57) &&
    (e.keyCode < 96 || e.keyCode > 105)
  ) {
    e.preventDefault();
  }
};

// Input attributes
type = "text";
inputMode = "decimal";
pattern = "[0-9]*\.?[0-9]{0,2}";
autoComplete = "off";
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Quote Calculation Testing

```bash
# Test CourierGuy quotes with different weights and cities
- 0.5kg textbook from Cape Town to Johannesburg
- 2kg multiple books from Durban to Pretoria
- Same city delivery in Cape Town

# Test ShipLogic API error handling
- Invalid address formats
- Excessive weight limits (>50kg)
- Invalid API responses
```

### Notification Testing

```bash
# Test notification visibility
- Create multiple notifications
- Verify all are visible without hover
- Test mark as read/delete functionality
- Check on different screen sizes
```

### Activity Log Testing

```bash
# Test activity logging
- Create a new book listing
- Purchase a book
- Update profile information
- Check Activity Log page for entries
```

### Price Input Testing

```bash
# Test price validation
- Try entering letters: "abc" → blocked
- Try multiple decimals: "12.34.56" → becomes "12.34"
- Try special characters: "12$%34" → becomes "1234"
- Test decimal limit: "12.999" → becomes "12.99"
- Test large numbers: "9999999" → becomes "999999"
```
