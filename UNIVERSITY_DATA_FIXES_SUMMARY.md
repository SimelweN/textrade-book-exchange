  - School of Pharmacy
  - School of Health Care Sciences
  - School of Science and Technology

### ‚úÖ **2. Fixed Critical Faculty Structure Corruption**

**Root Cause Identified**: The auto-generation system was corrupting existing faculty structures by:

- Force-enhancing ALL universities (`FORCE_COMPREHENSIVE_PROGRAMS = true`)
- Dumping generic programs into existing faculties
- Using loose name matching that misassigned programs

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Disabled Force Enhancement**: Set `FORCE_COMPREHENSIVE_PROGRAMS = false`
2. **Conservative Enhancement Criteria**: Changed from 100 programs to 10 programs minimum
3. **Verified-Only List**: Only universities in `UNIVERSITIES_NEEDING_PROGRAMS` can be enhanced
4. **Empty Enhancement List**: Currently no universities are in the enhancement list

### ‚úÖ **3. Program Verification Standards**

**New Standards Applied**:

- ‚úÖ **Real Programs Only**: All programs cross-checked against official university websites
- ‚úÖ **Correct Faculty Placement**: Programs placed in appropriate faculties based on official structures
- ‚úÖ **No Generic Copying**: Each university has programs specific to their actual offerings
- ‚úÖ **Official Faculty Names**: Faculty names match official university terminology

## üìä **Verification Sources Used**

### **Walter Sisulu University**

- ‚úÖ Official WSU website: https://wsu.ac.za/index.php/en/faculties-wsu
- ‚úÖ Verified 7 faculties and their respective programs
- ‚úÖ Confirmed degree offerings and requirements

### **University of Venda**

- ‚úÖ Official UNIVEN website: https://www.univen.ac.za/faculties/

- ‚úÖ Confirmed 5-school structure with health specializations

## üîß **Technical Improvements Made**

### **Data Structure Integrity**

```typescript
// Before: Corrupted auto-generation
FORCE_COMPREHENSIVE_PROGRAMS = true; // ‚ùå Corrupting all universities

// After: Conservative verified approach
FORCE_COMPREHENSIVE_PROGRAMS = false; // ‚úÖ Preserving manual structures
UNIVERSITIES_NEEDING_PROGRAMS = []; // ‚úÖ Only verified additions
```

### **Quality Assurance**

- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: All changes tested and building successfully
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces maintained
- ‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Faculty-program alignment verified
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Naming conventions standardized

## üéì **University Coverage Status**

### **Previously Missing - Now Added** ‚úÖ

- Walter Sisulu University (WSU)
- University of Venda (UNIVEN)
- University of Mpumalanga (UMP)
- Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU)

### **Previously Existing - Structure Preserved** ‚úÖ

- University of Cape Town (UCT)
- University of the Witwatersrand (Wits)
